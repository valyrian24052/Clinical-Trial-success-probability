Elranatamab will be given as a shot under the skin at the study clinic about once a week. This may change to a smaller number of shots later in the study.

The medicines in the combination therapy will be taken by mouth (at home or at the study clinic) AND will be given either as:

* a shot under the skin at the study clinic
* through a needle in the vein at the study clinic The number of times these medicines will be taken depends on what combination therapy the study doctor selects.

Participants may continue to receive elranatamab or a combination therapy until their MM is no longer responding. The study team will see how each participant is doing with the study treatment during regular visits at the study clinic. The study team will continue to follow-up with participants after study treatment with telephone contacts (or visits).

The study will compare the experiences of people receiving elranatamab to those people receiving a combination therapy. This will help learn about the safety and how effective elranatamab is.","Progression free survival per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years Overall survival, From date of randomization to date of discontinuation from study, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Progression free survival on next-line treatment per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of second objective disease progression, discontinuation from the study, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Objective response rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or start of new anticancer therapy, Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of response per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of confirmed objective response to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Very good partial response or better response rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Complete response rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of complete response per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of confirmed complete response to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Time to response per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of confirmed objective response, Up to approximately 5 years|Minimal residual disease negativity rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Sustained minimal residual disease negativity rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of randomization to date of progressive disease, discontinuation from study, death, or start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of minimal residual disease negativity rate per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, From date of minimal residual disease negativity to date of relapse, death, or censoring, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 5 years|Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, From date of first dose of study intervention up to 90 days after last study intervention administration|Frequency of abnormal laboratory results, From date of first dose of study intervention up to 90 days after last study intervention administration|Free elranatamab serum trough concentration [Ctrough], From date of first dose of elranatamab up to approximately 14 days after last dose of elranatamab|Elranatamab immunogenicity by anti-drug antibodies against elranatamab, From date of first dose of elranatamab up to approximately 14 days after last dose of elranatamab|Health-related quality of life by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30, Change from baseline scores, From date of informed consent up to approximately 35 days after last administration of study intervention|Health-related quality of life by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Myeloma 20, Change from baseline scores, From date of informed consent up to approximately 35 days after last administration of study intervention ",Pfizer,INDUSTRY,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,,,,Elranatamab,Elotuzumab,Pomalidomide,,,,,0,31.17,Approved

NCT05794906,0,0,-1,0,Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer,"A Study to Compare Darolutamide Given With Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) With ADT in Men With Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Raise of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels After Local Therapies Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men at high-risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer.

BCR means that in men who had prostate cancer and were treated by either surgery and/ or radiation therapy, the blood level of a specific protein called PSA rises. PSA is a marker of prostate cancer cells activity. The PSA increase means that the cancer has come back even though conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scans does not show any lesion of prostate cancer. Recently a more sensitive imaging method called prostate-specific membrane antigen \[PSMA\] positron emission tomography \[PET\]) /computed tomography \[CT\]) scan may identify prostate cancer lesions not detectable by conventional imaging. Men with BCR have a higher risk of their cancer spreading to other parts of the body, particularly when PSA levels raised to a certain limit within a short period of time after local therapies. Once the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it can become even harder to treat.

In men with prostate cancer, male sex hormones (also called androgens) like testosterone can help the cancer grow and spread. To reduce androgens levels in these patients, there are treatments that block androgens production in the body called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT is often used to stop prostate cancer. Another way to stop prostate cancer growth and spread is to block the action of androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells called androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs). The new generation ARIs including darolutamide can block the action of androgens receptors and are available for the treatment of prostate cancer in addition to ADT. It is already known that men with prostate cancer benefit from these treatments.

The main objective of this study is to learn if the combination of darolutamide and ADT prolongs the time that the participants live without their cancer getting worse, or to death due to any cause, compared to placebo (which is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it) and ADT given for a pre-specified duration of 24 months.

To do this, the study team will measure the time from the date of treatment allocation to the finding of new cancer spread in the participants by using PSMA PET/CT, or death due to any cause. The PSMA PET/CT scans is performed using a radioactive substance called a ""tracer"" that specifically binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) which is a protein often found in large amounts on prostate cancer cells.

To avoid bias in treatment, the study participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Based on the allocated treatment group, the participants will either take darolutamide plus ADT or placebo plus ADT twice daily as tablets by mouth. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and a follow-up phase. The treatment duration is pre-specified to be 24 months unless the cancer gets worse, the participants have medical problems, or they leave the study for any reason. In addition, image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) or surgery is allowed and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of this type of therapy.

During the study, the study team will:

* take blood and urine samples.
* measure PSA and testosterone levels in the blood samples
* do physical examinations
* check the participants' overall health
* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)
* check vital signs
* check cancer status using PSMA PET/CT scans, CT, MRI and bone scans
* take tumor samples (if required)
* ask the participants if they have medical problems

About 30 days after the participants have taken their last treatment, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and if their cancer worsened. The study team will continue to check this and regularly ask the participants questions about medical problems and subsequent therapies until they leave the study for any reason or until they leave the study for any reason or until the end of the study, whatever comes first.","Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) by Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) assessed by Blinded independent central review (BICR), After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 24 months Metastasis-free survival (MFS) by Conventional imaging (CI) assessed by BICR, After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Time to Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Time to initiation of first subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy, After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Time to loco-regional progression by PSMA PET/CT, After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Time to first Symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Overall survival (OS), After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) undetectable rates (<0.2 ng/mL), After randomization to after last treatment, approximately 46 months|Time to deterioration in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) total score, FACT-P is a multidimension, selfreport QoL instrument specifically designed for patients with prostate cancer.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does FHND9041 improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to afatinib?
* Are there differences in safety profiles between FHND9041 and afatinib?

Researchers will compare FHND9041 (80 mg, orally, once daily) with afatinib (40 mg, orally, once daily) in a randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, multicenter Phase III trial.

Participants who meet the inclusion criteria, including having EGFR mutations (L858R and/or Exon 19 deletion) and no prior treatment, will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the FHND9041 group or the afatinib group. Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerable drug-related toxicity, or other pre-specified treatment discontinuation criteria are met.

Study Procedures:

Participants will:

* Be screened for eligibility and randomly assigned to one of two groups.
* Receive study drugs per their assigned group.
* Undergo regular tumor assessments by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1( RECIST 1.1) every six weeks during the first 18 cycles, then every nine weeks until disease progression.

Zolbetuximab with chemotherapy may be used to treat stomach and GEJ cancer when the cancer cells do not have a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) on their surface (HER2-negative) but do have a protein called Claudin 18.2 (Claudin 18.2-positive). Zolbetuximab is thought to work by attaching to the Claudin 18.2 protein in their tumor, which switches on the body's immune system to attack the tumor. Certain stomach and GEJ cancers may be treated with immunotherapy, which helps the body's immune system fight cancer. This study will give more information about how well zolbetuximab works when given with an immunotherapy medicine called pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In this study, adults with stomach cancer or GEJ cancer will either be given zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A placebo looks like zolbetuximab but doesn't have any medicine in it.

The main aim of the study is to check how long people with stomach cancer and GEJ cancer live after treatment with zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy compared to placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.

Adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic stomach cancer or GEJ cancer can take part. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. A tumor sample (biopsy) of their cancer will have the Claudin 18.2 protein, PD-L1 protein, and be HER2-negative. They may have been previously treated with certain standard therapies. People cannot take part if they need to take medicines to suppress their immune system, have blockages or bleeding in their gut, have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in the nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.

The study treatments are either zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, or placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. People who take part will receive just 1 of the study treatments by chance. The people in the study and the study doctors will not know who takes which of the study treatments. Study treatment will be given in 6-week (42-day) cycles. The study treatment is mainly given to people slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will receive study treatment as follows: Zolbetuximab or placebo: 1 infusion every 2 or 3 weeks (2 or 3 infusions in a cycle) together with: Chemotherapy (1 of the following types of chemotherapy): 1. CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion of oxaliplatin every 3 weeks (2 infusions in a cycle). People will also take 1 tablet of capecitabine twice a day for 2 weeks (14 days) at the start of each cycle (Day 1) and again in the middle of each cycle (Day 22). After 8 study treatments people will receive capecitabine only. 2. Modified FOLFOX6 or mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion every 2 weeks (3 infusions in a cycle). After 12 study treatments people will receive folinic acid and fluorouracil only, instead of mFOLFOX6. Pembrolizumab: 1 infusion every 3 or 6 weeks (1 or 2 infusions in a cycle). People can be in the study and will receive study treatment until their cancer worsens, they cannot tolerate the study treatment, or they need to start another cancer treatment. People may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. People will visit the clinic on certain days to receive their study treatment and have health checks. The study doctors will check if people had any medical problems from taking zolbetuximab or the other study treatments. On some visits they will have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. People will have the option of giving a tumor sample if they stop treatment because their cancer has worsened. People will visit the clinic after they stop their study treatment. People will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check. People will continue to have scans every 9 or 12 weeks to check for any changes in their cancer. They will have telephone health checks every 3 months. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not.","Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause., Up to 72 months Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiologic PD \[investigator-assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1\] or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., Up to 72 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants who have a Best Overall Response (BOR) or Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as investigator assessed per RECIST V1.1., Up to 57 Months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the date of the first response (CR/PR) until the date of PD as investigator-assessed per RECIST V1.1 or date of death from any cause, whichever is earlier., Up to 72 Months|Number of participants with adverse Events (AEs), Adverse events (AEs) will coded using MedDRA.

Advanced NSCLC is a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body or that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. HER2 is a protein that helps cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the building plans (genes) for this protein in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal HER2 and therefore abnormal cell growth and division.

The study treatment, BAY 2927088, is expected to block the mutated HER2 protein which may stop the spread of NSCLC.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how well BAY 2927088 works and how safe it is compared with standard treatment, in participants who have advanced NSCLC with specific genetic changes called HER2 mutations.

The study participants will receive one of the study treatments:

* BAY 2927088 twice every day as a tablet by mouth, or
* Standard treatment in cycles of 21 days via infusion (""drip"") into the vein. The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe side effects or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment.

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* take imaging scans, including CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, of different parts of the body to study the spread of cancer
* check the overall health of the participants by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking
* heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* perform pregnancy tests for women
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatment.","Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1; BICR = blinded independent central review (BICR), Up to approximately 2 years Overall survival (OS), Up to approximately 4 years.|Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1; BICR = blinded independent central review (BICR), Up to approximately 4 years|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, Up to approximately 4 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, Up to approximately 4 years|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1; BICR = blinded independent central review (BICR), Up to approximately 4 years|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator, RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, Up to approximately 4 years|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BICR, BICR = blinded independent central review (BICR), Up to approximately 4 years|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the investigator, Up to approximately 4 years|Adverse events per CTCAE v 5.0 (eg.

After the completion of standard chemotherapy, all patients continue to receive maintenance therapy with toripalimab injection or its placebo in combination with lenvatinib mesylate capsule or its placebo until unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression and loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigators, start of new anti-cancer therapy, death, other conditions requiring termination of study treatment, or the patient meets the criteria for study withdrawal, whichever occurs first.

In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for unconfirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos will be permitted to continue treatment if their clinical status or symptoms are stable or improved (as determined by the investigators) or until loss of clinical benefit. Patients with confirmed disease progression should discontinue toripalimab, lenvatinib, or their placebos.

Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and during the study treatment per protocol. In the absence of progression, tumor assessments will continue as scheduled, regardless of whether study treatment ends, until confirmed disease progression or other criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first. Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 criteria for progression should undergo tumor assessments as scheduled if clinical benefits of continuing study treatment are determined by investigators until progression is confirmed per iRECIST (iCPD), or the criteria for study withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.

Computerized tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for efficacy evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the first year (52 weeks), and every 9 weeks (Q9W) in the second year (after week 52).

All AEs and concomitant medications during the study will be recorded.

* High-risk, which means the cancer may have a higher chance of getting worse or coming back after treatment
* Early-stage, which means the cancer is in the breast or the lymph nodes around the breast The 2 types of breast cancer in this study are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor (HR)-low positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. These cancers have zero or a low amount of a protein called HER2 and other proteins that attach to the hormones estrogen or progesterone.

Sacituzumab tirumotecan (also known as sac-TMT or MK-2870), the study medicine, is a type of targeted therapy. A targeted therapy is a treatment that works to control how specific types of cancer cells grow and spread.

The main goals of this study are to learn if people who receive sac-TMT, pembrolizumab, and chemotherapy:

* Have fewer cancer cells found in the tumors and lymph nodes removed during surgery compared to those who receive only pembrolizumab and chemotherapy

The study is focused on participants who have one of two types of cancer: follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back after treatment (called ""relapsed""), or did not respond to treatment (called ""refractory""). FL and MZL are subtypes of Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma (NHL).

This study will be made up of two parts (Part 1 not randomized, Part 2 randomized - controlled).

The aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is when used in combination with lenalidomide, in participants with FL or MZL, and to determine the dose of the study drug to be used in Part 2 of this study. This combination is considered ""first-in-human"" as it has not been tested as a combination treatment in humans before.

The aim of Part 2, of the study is to assess how the combination of the study drug and lenalidomide works compared to the combination of rituximab (called ""the comparator drug"") and lenalidomide. The combination of comparator drug and lenalidomide is the current standard-of care treatment for FL and/or MZL. Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug in combination with lenalidomide
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
